**Steps For Using Quick BMS**

**1) Open quickbms.exe, or alternatively, quickbms_4gb_files.exe if you're working with larger .PAK files.**

**2) It will start with what looks like a standard Windows cmd prompt and file selection prompt, select the unreal_tournament_4_0.4.25d.bms script, and click open.**

**3) After this, a new file selection prompt will pop up, the old one will close. Select the .PAK file you wish to extract with QuickBMS, and then click open.**

**4) Finally, the final file selection prompt will now pop up, with the last one closing. This is the folder the files within the .PAK file will be extracted to, select whatever folder you wish to extract to, then click save. The full process of extracting the files may take several minutes, but you have now extracted the files! :)**
